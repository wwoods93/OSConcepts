This is an intitial implementation of the maps_parser found in the repository of that same name.
This implementation uses free functions to parse the output of the pmap -x [PID] command in Linux.
The parser performs some basic calculations to provide some insight into virtual memory usage on a Linux machine.
See the maps_parser repository for a more complete version of the program.
